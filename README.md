# Dockerized-Flask-Web-App
This project is a basic Dockerized Flask Web Application designed to demonstrate how a Python-based web app can be containerized and deployed using Docker. The app is built using the lightweight Flask framework and responds with a simple "Hello, Docker!" message when accessed. It serves as an excellent starting point for understanding how to use Docker to package and deploy Python applications, making the deployment process easier and more portable across different environments.

# Features
Containerization: The entire Flask application runs in a Docker container, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments across various environments.
Lightweight: Uses Python's slim image for a minimal Docker image footprint, making it faster to build and deploy.
Portability: The application can run on any platform that supports Docker, whether it's Linux, macOS, or Windows.
Simplicity: The app is simple and easy to understand, serving as a perfect starting point for learning how to containerize applications.
Extensibility: Easily extend the project by adding more routes, connecting to databases, or deploying it on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.

# Prerequisites
Docker: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can install Docker from here.
Basic Knowledge of Flask: While the app is simple, a basic understanding of Flask will help you extend the project further if needed.
